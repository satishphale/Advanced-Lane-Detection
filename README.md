**Advanced lane finding project**

The steps for this project are following:-

* Campute camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficient of the given set of chessboard images
* Apply distortion correlation to the raw images
* Apply color transformation, gradients, etc., to create thresholded binary images
* Apply a perspective transformation to rectify binary image("bird-eye-view")
* Detect lane pixel and fit to find the lane boundary
