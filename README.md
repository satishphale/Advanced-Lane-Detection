**Advanced lane finding project**

The steps for this project are following:-

* Campute camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficient of the given set of chessboard images.
* Apply distortion correlation to the raw images.
* Apply color transformation, gradients, etc., to create thresholded binary images.
* Apply a perspective transformation to rectify binary image.("bird-eye-view")
* Detect lane pixel and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine curvature of lane and position of car with respect to the center.
* Warp detected lane boundaries back to the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
